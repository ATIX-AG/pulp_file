Sync is no longer available at the {remote_href}/sync/ repository={repo_href} endpoint. Instead, use POST {repo_href}/sync/ remote={remote_href}.

Creating / listing / editing / deleting file repositories is now performed on /pulp/api/v3/file/file/ instead of /pulp/api/v3/repositories/. Only file content can be present in a file repository, and only a file repository can hold file content.
